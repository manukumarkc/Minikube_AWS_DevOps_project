**Project Creation Explanation:**


-Phase1: Creation of Static Web page using HTML and Flask and Containerize using Docker.
 - 
  The idea is to create a Static web page serving on Docker Container deployed inside Kubernetes Cluster and Exposing to Public access on AWS EC2 instance .

  Step1: Create AWS EC2 instance with t2.large instance size Configuration and SSH to EC2 .

    ```bash
      ssh -i "<PemPrivateKey>.pem" ubuntu@ec2-<ip-address>.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
   ```

  -Upgrade the EC2 Ubuntu Instance to latest version, create a Directory named hello-k8s-app.

     ```bash
       mkdir hello-k8s-app
    ```
  -add app.py file and enter the contents as it is from the above GitHub file,(or You Clone this Git Repository to get complete code on your local repo)

  -Flask app.py which serves HTML content within its renderning page function created and run locally to see the application with Header and Body and Footer html content.
  
  -Contains Flask as Dependency requirement inside requirement.txt for the application.
   

 Step2: Docker file creation to create a Docker Container image to run app on Minikube cluster
     -Below are the Contents of Dockerfile,
   ```bash
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```   
  -Build the Docker Image with the Below command.
```bash
docker build -t hello-world-app .
```

-Step2: CI-CD pipeline with Multistage Build using GitHub Actions.

-To Automate the App Building process and Verification process of the Static application, we used GitHUb Actions to Build Ci-Cd workflow, the Ci-Cd yml file create in the below given address .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml, below are the contents of Pipeline which ensures the application is correct and building process runs with linting and containerizes the application with latest Docker image on every Git Push action configured on main branch.

Below is the Ci-Cd.yml file for static web app:


-Configuring Trigger on Git Push Requets to the main branch.
 -The Workflow pipeline is triggered with every push actions performed and create new build from the recent change done on main branch.

-Below are the explanation for above steps in CI-CD pipeline worflow stages.



```bash
 steps:
    # ✅ Step 1: Checkout the repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # ✅ Step 2: Install and run flake8 for linting
    - name: Run flake8 linter
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8
        flake8 app.py

    # ✅ Step 3: Set up Docker
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    # ✅ Step 4: Build the Docker image
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t hello-world-app .

    # ✅ Step 5: Save the Docker image to a local tarball
    - name: Save Docker image to tar file
      run: |
        mkdir -p docker-output
        docker save hello-world-app -o docker-output/hello-world-app.tar

    # ✅ Step 6: Upload the tarball as a GitHub artifact
    - name: Upload Docker image tarball
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: docker-image
        path: docker-output/hello-world-app.tar
```
-Step1: Checkout application code from repository.

-Step2: Installs and Runs Flake8 for Liniting and Cheking the code format.

-Step3: Set up Docker for Building Docker images on the local machine using Dockerfile.

-Step4:Building of Hello-world Docker image using the Docker build command.

-Step5:Docker image is Saved in tar file in the local directory(as suggested not to publish in Docker Hub).

-Step6:Upload the tart ball into github Artifact to access every newly built latest image and retrive them when needed.


-Phase3: Kubernetes Deployment on Minikube Cluster(Inside AWS EC2 Instance).

-this phase explaining how we installed and Configured Minikube on EC2 Instanc2(t2.large), Built Docker image inside Minikube, Deployed application using Kubernetes Manifests like Deployment yaml and service Yaml and Cross checked pod and service are running correctly.

-Step 1: Installing MiniKube and Kubectl on EC2.(installig Docker and Kubectl, Minikube with Bash)

-Docker Install:

sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

-Kubectl Install:

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

-Minikube Install:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

Step2:Start the MiniKube with Docker Driver:

minikube start --driver=docker

Check Status of Minikube:

minikube status


Step3: Ensure Minikube uses Docker Daemon for running application,Confirming Docker image is visible inside Minikube cluster:

eval $(minikube docker-env)

Step4: build the Docker image inside Minikube with Existing Dockerfile:

docker build -t hello-world-app .

Step5: Create Kuberenets Manifests files (Deployment and Service YAML files):

-Inside k8s directory create Deployment.yaml and service.yaml files add the below contents:

-inside k8s/deployment.yaml:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: hello-world-app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000

-Inside k8s/service.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: hello
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 5000
    nodePort: 30007

-Step7: appliy Kubernets Manifests file:

kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml

-Check the status of Kubernets pods and Services:

kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc

-Step8: Check the Minikube Ip and test curl for application output:

minikube ip

curl http://<minikube-ip>:30007


-Step4: Expose the App via Nginx Reverse Proxy for Public using AWS EC2 Public IP.

-Once the app is deployed on Minikube, its accessible internally via Minikube's IP and NodePort Service, but it does not available publically on any browser and with the EC2 public IP address , so i need a tunnel service or reverse Proxy or Loadbalancer to host publicly on Internet,i choosed Nginx as a Reverse proxy inside EC2 instance.

-below are the steps to configure and access static web app on EC2 public IP.

-Step1: Installing NGINX service on EC2:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y

-Step2: Get Minikube IP and NodePort Service Address:

minikube ip
kubectl get svc

-Step3:Configuring NGINX Reverse Proxy, Edit the Nginx Config file:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default


server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    server_name _;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:30007;  # Minikube Ip is served to public IP of EC2 for Public acccess of EC2.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}


-step4:Save and Test the nginx configuration file and Restart the service:

sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx


-Step5: Application Access on Public EC2 Ip address:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
